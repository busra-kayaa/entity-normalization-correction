    "Members of a legislature, called legislators, may be elected, indirectly chosen, or appointed, and legislatures may be unicameral, bicameral, or multicameral, depending on their constitutional design.",
    "There are several types of legislatures, reflecting the different constitutional principles of power on which states are organized.",
    "These types illustrate how legislatures differ not only in structure and function, but also in their constitutional relationship to other state institutions and in the theories of sovereignty and power that underpin them.",
    "There exist different types of legislatures.",
    "In liberal democratic systems, there exist two: parliaments and congress legislatures.",
    "Unlike parliament, there are no commonly agreed-upon terms for legislatures in non-parliamentary liberal democracies.",
    "Parliaments exist in states that practice the fusion of powers, while congresses exist in states that practice the separation of powers.",
    "There also exist other types of legislatures, such as the supreme state organs of power (SSOP) in communist states, which function within the bounds of unified power.",
    "Types of legislatures are defined by, as shown, the political power system they operate in.",
    "These power principles say something about the relationship between the legislature and other state institutions.",
    "For example, that the United Kingdom has a Parliament means that it practices fusion of powers, while Mexico's Congress of the Union informs that Mexico practices the separation of powers.",
    "According to scholar Amie Kreppel, the most important distinguishing feature between a type of legislature is the relationship between the legislature and the executive.",
    "In liberal democratic states that practice parliamentary democracy, the government in the form of the prime minister and the cabinet is elected by the legislature.",
    "The members of the government are elected from within the membership of parliament.",
    "Additionally, although an institutionally distinct organ, the government is accountable to parliament.",
    "Meaning that, theoretically, the legislature can remove the government as it sees fit, regardless of electoral outcomes.",
    "However, the removal of a government by the legislature can lead to early elections and result in both losing power in the coming election.",
    "Senior management, executive management, or upper management is an occupation at the highest level of management of an organization, performed by individuals who have the day-to-day tasks of managing the organization, sometimes a company or a corporation.",
    "Executive managers hold executive powers delegated to them with and by authority of a board of directors and/or the shareholders.",
    "Generally, higher levels of responsibility exist, such as a board of directors and those who own the company (shareholders), but they focus on managing the senior or executive management instead of on the day-to-day activities of the business.",
    "The executive management typically consists of the heads of a firm's product and/or geographic units and of functional executives such as the chief financial officer, the chief operating officer, and the chief strategy officer.",
    "In project management, senior management authorises the funding of projects.",
    "Senior management are sometimes referred to, within corporations, as executive management, top management, upper management, higher management, or simply seniors.",
    "A top management is a specific form of which typically consists of some of the top managers in a firm.",
    "However, there is no clear definition to what the top management of an organization is.",
    "It is put together by the chief executive officer (CEO) to work on a specific task.",
    "In working on this task, it generally has a much higher responsibility and higher autonomy than other types of teams.",
    "The way top management is put together and work together as a team can greatly differ from other teams.",
    "This is mainly based on the fact that top managers have succeeded as individuals which often leads to a focus on functional team objectives rather than to working interdependently on a shared goal.",
    "Top management consist of top managers from different functional areas of the firm, so they usually have different areas of expertise.",
    "Diversity and heterogeneity in teams can have a positive effect on teamwork.",
    "Nevertheless, there are also negative effects which have to be overcome as a team like not valuing different opinions and perspectives.",
    "A CEO that models valuing behavior and ensures the team has both a clear purpose and clear objectives can do just that.",
    "This also reduces social categorization effects because it leads to team members focusing more on their shared goals than on their differences.",
    "The exchange of information during the working process is as important for top managements as it is for all other kinds of teams.",
    "In order to work effectively, the team needs to understand how to communicate, share information, set goals, give feedback, manage conflict, engage in joint planning and task coordination and solve problems collaboratively.",
    "The CEO plays a key role in enabling the team to do so.",
    "The CEO must take on the responsibility to coach the team and to reflect on their work.",
    "In their research in 2005, Simsek and colleagues found that especially a CEO's collectivistic orientation has a positive influence on team work behavior.",
    "The judiciary (also known as the judicial system, judicature, judicial branch, judiciative branch, and court or judiciary system) is the system of courts that adjudicates legal disputes/disagreements and interprets, defends, and applies the law in legal cases.",
    "The judiciary is the system of courts that interprets, defends, and applies the law in the name of the state.",
    "The judiciary can also be thought of as the mechanism for the resolution of disputes.",
    "However, in some countries the judiciary does make common law.",
    "In many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through the process of judicial review.",
    "Courts with judicial review power may annul the laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm, such as primary legislation, the provisions of the constitution, treaties or international law.",
    "Judges constitute a critical force for judicial interpretation and constitutional review while avoiding political bias.",
    "This is a more general overview of the development of the judiciary and judicial systems over the course of history.",
    "The most important part was Ius Civile (Latin for \"civil law\").",
    "This consisted of Mos Maiorum (Latin for \"way of the ancestors\") and Leges (Latin for \"laws\").",
    "Mos Maiorum was a set of rules of conduct based on social norms created over the years by predecessors.",
    "In 451–449 BC, the Mos Maiorum was written down in the Twelve Tables.",
    "Leges were rules set by the leaders, first the kings, later the popular assembly during the Republic.",
    "In these early years, the legal process consisted of two phases.",
    "The first phase, In Iure, was the judicial process.",
    "One would go to the head of the judicial system (at first the priests as law was part of religion) who would look at the applicable rules to the case.",
    "Parties in the case could be assisted by jurists.",
    "Then the second phase would start, the Apud Iudicem.",
    "The case would be put before the judges, which were normal Roman citizens in an uneven number.",
    "They were orators rather than jurists.",
    "There were no rules of evidence, and little recourse against an adverse judgment.",
    "The most important change in this period was the shift from priest to praetor as the head of the judicial system.",
    "A monarch () is a head of state for life or until abdication, and therefore the head of state of a monarchy.",
    "A monarch usually exercises the highest authority and power in the state.",
    "Alternatively, an individual may proclaim oneself monarch, or even usurp power, as many Ancient Greek tyrants did.",
    "If a young child is crowned the monarch, then a regent is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule.",
    "Monarchy is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with hereditary rule.",
    "Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a royal family (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a dynasty) and trained for future duties.",
    "Different systems of succession have been used, such as proximity of blood (male preference or absolute), primogeniture, agnatic seniority, Salic law, etc.",
    "While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term queen regnant refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a queen consort, the wife of a reigning king.",
    "In an elective monarchy, the monarch is elected but otherwise serves as any other monarch.",
    "Historical examples of elective monarchy include the Holy Roman Emperors (chosen by prince-electors, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the free election of kings of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.",
    "Modern examples include the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (lit.",
    "In recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become republics.",
    "Advocacy of government by a republic is called republicanism, while advocacy of monarchy is called monarchism.",
    "A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase \"The King is dead.",
    "In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g., most modern constitutional monarchies), real leadership does not depend on the monarch.",
    "Hereditary succession within one patrilineal family has been most common (but see the Rain Queen), with a preference for children over siblings, and sons over daughters.",
    "In Europe, some people practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the medieval era and sometimes (e.g., Ernestine duchies) into the 19th century.",
    "Other European realms practiced one or another form of primogeniture, in which a lord was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.",
    "The system of tanistry practiced among Celtic tribes was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.",
    "The Salic law, practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the House of Savoy, stipulated that only men could inherit the crown.",
    "In most fiefs, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the patrilineage, a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law).",
    "In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, jure uxoris.",
    "A republic, based on the Latin phrase res publica ('public thing' or 'people's thing'), is a state in which political power rests with the public (people), typically through their representatives—in contrast to a monarchy.",
    "Although a republic is most often a single sovereign state, subnational state entities that have governments that are republican in nature may be referred to as republics.",
    "Representation in a republic may or may not be freely elected by the general citizenry.",
    "As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \"republic\" as part of their official names.",
    "Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word \"republic\" used in the names of all states with elected governments.",
    "The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC.",
    "The term originates from the Latin translation of Greek word politeia.",
    "Cicero, among other Latin writers, translated politeia into Latin as res publica, and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as republic (or similar terms in various European languages).",
    "The term can literally be translated as 'public matter'.",
    "It was used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the Roman Empire.",
    "The term politeia can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime, and it does not necessarily imply any specific type of regime as the modern word republic sometimes does.",
    "One of Plato's major works on political philosophy, usually known in English as The Republic, was titled Politeia.",
    "However, apart from the title, modern translations are generally used.",
    "In later Latin works the term republic can also be used in a general way to refer to any regime, or to refer specifically to governments which work for the public good.",
    "In medieval Northern Italy, a number of city states had commune or signoria based governments.",
    "In the late Middle Ages, writers such as Giovanni Villani described these states using terms such as libertas populi, a free people.",
    "The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed interest in the writings of Ancient Rome caused writers to prefer classical terminology.",
    "To describe non-monarchical states, writers (most importantly, Leonardo Bruni) adopted the Latin phrase res publica.",
    "While Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term res publica has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin.",
    "In subsequent centuries, the English word commonwealth came to be used as a translation of res publica, and its use in English was comparable to how the Romans used the term res publica.",
    "Notably, during The Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell the word commonwealth was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, but the word republic was also in common use.",

    "Locke believed that the legislative power was supreme over the executive and federative powers, which are subordinate.",
    "Locke reasoned that the legislative was supreme because it has law-giving authority; \"or what can give laws to another, must need to be superior to him\" (Second Treatise, § 150).",
    "According to Locke, legislative power derives its authority from the people, who have the right to make and unmake the legislature.",

    "The phrase \"face book,\" a printed collection of individuals' faces and names, was first used by the character George in Season 6 Episode 1 of Newhart, which first aired on September 14, 1987.",
    "Colleges and universities in the United States have often published official or unofficial books listing their students, faculty, or staff, together with pictures and limited biographical data.",
    "By the early 2000s, some face books were being published online offering a number of new features, including password protection, more detailed information, more advanced indexing and searching, and the ability for people to upload and enter information and photographs.",
    "The development of a campus-wide face book had previously been stalled by privacy concerns, many of which became prominent in November 2003 when Zuckerberg was accused of breaching security and violating copyrights and individual privacy.",
    "Zuckerberg had created a website, www.facemash.com, that used photos taken without authorization from Harvard House–based face books, using the photos in a system to rate the attractiveness of students.",
    "Winter is the coldest and darkest season of the year in temperate and polar climates.",
    "It occurs after autumn and before spring, when the hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun as a result of the tilt of Earth's axis.",
    "Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.",
    "When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.",
    "Winter typically brings precipitation that, depending on a region's climate, is mainly rain or snow.",
    "The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole.",
    "The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.",
    "The English word winter comes from the Proto-Germanic noun *wintru-, whose origin is unclear.",
    "Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the Proto-Indo-European root *wed- 'water' or a nasal infix variant *wend-.",
    "The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather.",
    "The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit.",
    "This variation brings about seasons.",
    "When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun.",
    "From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.",
    "During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle.",
    "Thus a lower amount of solar radiation strikes the Earth per unit of surface area.",
    "Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat.",
    "Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.",
    "The manifestation of meteorological winter in the northerly snow-prone latitudes is highly variable, depending on elevation, position versus marine winds, and the amount of precipitation.",
    "For instance, Winnipeg, a city in the landlocked Great Plains region within Canada, has a January high of −11.3 °C (11.7 °F) and a low of −21.4 °C (−6.5 °F).",
    "In comparison, Vancouver, a city on Canada's west coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds, has a January low of 1.4 °C (34.5 °F), with days well above freezing, at 6.9 °C (44.4 °F).",
